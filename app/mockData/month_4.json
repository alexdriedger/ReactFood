[{"description": "You are cordially invited to join us on April 1, 2016 for an exciting evening of Art Historical discussion and critical reflection. The symposium comprises the presentation and discussion of a range of undergraduate research treating on contemporary and historical issues. This year's topics examine various art historical discourses, including: the amplification of brand value through imaging; the exploration of technophobia and transphobia assisted by advances in biotechnology, through the lens of the \u201cThe Cyborg Manifesto;\u201d and, finally, the expression of national identity through the principle of \u201cone in the all (wanwu guiyi)\u201d that is firmly associated with history, society and Chinese culture. Each presentation will be followed by a conversation period during which all students and faculty are encouraged to voice questions and comments. Refreshments will be provided during intermission and final reception.\n \nThe Undergraduate Journal of Art History and Visual Culture (UJAH) will launch their 7th issue at the symposium. This publication features the exceptional body of research, art, and writing taking place in all undergraduate art disciplines at UBC, as well as the abstracts of this year\u2019s symposium papers.\n \n3:00PM \u2013 Introduction\n \nBlake Finucane, #Branded: Christie\u2019s in the Age of Digital Image Circulation\n \nRan Zheng, To Move The Mountain: The Image Of Collectivity In Chinese Contemporary Art\n \n4:00-4:10PM \u2013 Intermission\n \nLucas Kling, The Cyborg Complex: Technophobia, Transphobia, and American Reflexxx \n \n5:00PM \u2013 Reception \n \nUBC Art History Students\u2019 Association\nEmail: ubcahsa@gmail.com\nFacebook: Facebook.com/UBCAHSA\nwww.ahva.ubc.ca", "start_time": "2016-04-01T15:00:00-0700", "end_time": "2016-04-01T18:30:00-0700", "name": "12th Annual Art History Undergraduate Symposium & UJAH Issue 7 Launch", "place": {"name": "Audain Art Centre", "location": {"city": "Vancouver", "country": "Canada", "latitude": 49.2638682, "longitude": -123.2547265, "state": "BC", "street": "6398 University Avenue"}, "id": "1405143836412956"}, "id": "1705623736372198", "owner": {"name": "UBC Art History, Visual Art and Theory", "id": "111982666071"}}, {"description": "Ever had a conversation that sounded like this?\n\n\u201c Alpha: Dude you look tired.\n.
