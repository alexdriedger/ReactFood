By participating in academic research, you are not only adding to the world of scholarly knowledge, you are also contributing to a canon of thought that will propel us into the future. At its root, research seeks to pull from a variety of diverse sources in order to create unique ideas. In doing so, students have the power to play an active part in shaping the world around us.\n\nThe focus of this year's conference is on INNOVATION. We are therefore seeking to highlight the important place of undergraduate thought in this evolutionary process.\nOur conference aims to do this by providing a platform for students from all levels of undergraduate study to present their work, allowing them to enter into scholastic dialogue both with their peers, who are actively involved in this evolution, and with professors, who have previously been through this process themselves, and who are ensuring that it continues to take place in current students.\n\nAttendance is free and includes complimentary lunch, refreshments, and prize raffle entry. Register at this link to attend: https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/aus-humanities-social-sciences-conference-innovation-tickets-19670470908\n\nCRITERIA FOR SUBMISSIONS:\nWe are accepting submissions as of NOVEMBER 16, 2015 - DECEMBER 16, 2015. \n\nWe welcome submissions of presentation proposals from all universities and colleges in BC. Students may present work done as term papers, honours theses, or independent research projects; works in progress may also be eligible. Presentations should be no longer than 15 minutes, in English, and should represent work done while the presenter was an undergraduate student. The deadline for submissions is December 16th, 2015.\n\nThis year we have extended our submissions to include the work of Fine Arts students. Submissions can be 2D or 3D art pieces. Canvases may not be smaller than 12\u2019 X 12\u201d and no larger than 36\u201d X 48\u201d.\n\nFor more information: \nhttp://aus.arts.ubc.ca/events/conference/\nOR send us an email on: \naus.conference@gmail.com\n\n#thisisyourhAUS #12000strong", "start_time": "2016-01-16T10:30:00-0800", "end_time": "2016-01-16T17:30:00-0800", "name": "The AUS Presents: The AUS Humanities & Social Sciences Conference", "place": {"name": "AMS Student Nest", "location": {"city": "Vancouver", "country": "Canada", "latitude": 49.266485668, "longitude": -123.24990050775, "state": "BC", "street": "6133 University Boulevard", "zip": "V6T 1Z1"}, "id": "1650598338487394"}, "id": "1639893986258522", "owner": {"name": "UBC Arts Undergraduate Society", "id": "107744622618307"}}, {"description": "Hello Arts students of UBC!

Why?
