Are you interested on working for a startup project that will make a significant social impact? Or maybe you are interested in learning how to combine entrepreneurship with computer science and finding out what resources UBC has to offer for student entrepreneurs? If any of those ideals appealed to you, then come by Project Hub\u2019s kickoff event featuring speakers Andrea Lloyd from e@UBC and Bryana Russell from Lean Launch Pad. Get ready for an engaging presentation on using tech for social good as well as an opportunity to work on Jooles, a startup project focused on female health. Refreshments will be provided, so see you there on Jan 13 at ICICS rm 014 from 5-7pm!\n\n\n\nWhat is Jooles?\nJooles is a gameified, educational menstrual cycle charting app for young women aged 11-15. Some of the root causes of health issues later in life are the same conditions that cause distressing symptoms of hormone abnormalities in adolescence. We aim to educate women to understand their bodies, to encourage users identify patterns that could explain their health concerns, and engage youth in overcoming the taboos and discomfort that persists around women's cycles.\n\nWhat is Social/Impact Venture?\nImpact ventures are for-purpose organizations that focus on important local and global challenges with a strong emphasis on maximizing positive impact in areas such as social, health, and environment. e@UBC programs help venture teams discover and validate a business model that can achieve the purpose-driven mission while fueling financial sustainability and growth of the venture. Facilitators and mentors include entrepreneurs and executives that have experience working with impact-focused organizations.\n\nhttp://entrepreneurship.ubc.ca/social-venture-stream/", "small_pic_url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c41.0.50.50/p50x50/15873125_1407142339309559_4831428425525654024_n.jpg?oh=392b0f6597b4a6b891a3b56d59d4026b&oe=5A0CBB2D"}, {"id": "1254013554689295", "name": "2 Bucks-a-Beaker: January Edition", "start_time": "2017-01-13T17:30:00-0800", "end_time": "2017-01-13T22:00:00-0800", "attending_count": 61, "maybe_count": 114, "cover": {"offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50, "source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15965264_1504224142922909_6410696620854136723_n.jpg?oh=41ec7b3ad9514d60c48bb967be94c88b&oe=5A041CCE", "id": "1504224142922909"}, "owner": {"name": "Undergraduate Chemistry Society at UBC", "id": "356972127648122"}, "place": {"name": "Abdul Ladha Science Student Centre", "location": {"city": "Vancouver", "country": "Canada", "latitude": 49.2661219, "longitude": -123.2510003, "state": "BC", "street": "2055 East Mall", "zip": "V6T 1Z1"}, "id": "152819448084339"}, "is_canceled": false, "updated_time": "2017-01-07T21:53:18+0000", "category": "MEETUP", "description": "Come celebrate the start of a new year and semester with both the Undergraduate Chemistry Society (UCS) and Chemistry Graduate Student Society (CGSS) at the first 2-Bucks-a-Beaker of 2017!\n\n\u2605 Date: Friday, January 13\n\u2605 Time: 5:30 - 10:00 PM\n\u2605 Location: Abdul Ladha Science Student Centre\n\u2605 Free to enter!\n\u2605 Free pizza, chips, soda, and water provided.\n\n\ud83c\udfab $2 per drink / $5 per drink + beaker\n\n\ud83c\udf7a This is a 19+ event. 2 pieces of valid ID are required, including 1 government-issued photo ID.", "small_pic_url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/c34.0.50.50/p50x50/15965264_1504224142922909_6410696620854136723_n.jpg?oh=bdcc4e5e7c6c45335c88213aba6f561b&oe=59F59097"}, {"id": "1710802912565181", "name": "AUS x UBC Filmsoc: Violent", "start_time": "2017-01-19T19:00:00-0800", "end_time": "2017-01-19T22:00:00-0800", "attending_count": 37, "maybe_count": 115, "cover": {"offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 250, "source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/15965557_1253893904670034_3496845560087684994_n.png?oh=3fbf0006118f0c92b808c5837a1c11ba&oe=5A069402", "id": "1253893904670034"}, "owner": {"name": "UBC Arts Undergraduate Society", "id": "107744622618307"}, "place": {"name": "Buch D217"}, "is_canceled": false, "updated_time": "2017-01-20T02:59:03+0000", "category": "MOVIE_EVENT", "description": "North of 49 Movies on Campus, UBC Arts Undergraduate Society, and UBC Film Society are excited to invite you to a free screening of the movie Violent.\n\nViolent follows the story of Dagny, a young woman longing to escape her small-town life, and her reminiscences of the five people who loved her most all while experiencing a clear epiphany.
