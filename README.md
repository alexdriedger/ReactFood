## Features

### 🍩 Published on the Play Store & App Store

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🍩 Scavenge was available on the Play Store and App Store in 2017-2018

### 🍉 Python Back End

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🍉 [Facebook's Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/) was used to get all events on campus

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🍉 Natural Language Processing used to determine which events had free food

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🍉 Events with free food were processed and pushed to an API running on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

### 🍴 Flask API on Heroku

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🍴 [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) (and Python) were used to develop an API to serve events to the app

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🍴 The API was hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

### 🍕 React Native App for Android & iOS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🍕 [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) was used to create a cross-platform app available on both Android and iOS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🍕 [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) were both heavily used libraries in Scavenge

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🍕 Scavenge pulled events from the API on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to always have the latest events for users 

### 🥨 DevOps

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🥨 Builds were automated with [Visual Studio App Center](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/app-center/)
